        <h2>Why is the Chupacabra my favorite?</h2>
        <br>

        <p>He really isn't.  I just thought it would be better to pick something other than a monkey.  I heard about it growing up and the idea of such creature sounded terrifying but the fact that they made chupacabra candy growing up made it a less terrifying idea.</p>
